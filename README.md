im good at art i promise this is just a bad example


### What is **Pynt!** ?
**Pynt!** is an extremely simple etch-a-sketch program written using some of the most basic Pygame functionality possible. It is essentially something I threw together after an evening at the pub using the most advanced techniques I could possibly come up with after watching the first episode in a ten-part Pygame introduction, getting bored, and screwing around with image persistence.

### How do I install **Pynt!** ?
download ``pynt.py`` and make sure you have the latest version of Pygame installed. If you don't, uhh, I think you can just use ``pip install pygame`` or something like that. Once that's done, open ``pynt.py`` in IDLE or whatever on Windows and if you're on Linux you should know what to do.

### What can **Pynt!** do?
The problems facing the internet as we understand it require the most modern and capable tools we have at our disposal. Because of this, no expense has been spared in creating this software framework. After dozens of minutes of research and development, we've perfected a patent-pending unpatentable trichromatic display technology that scoffs at the concept of a "black and white only" color scheme. The industry has become stagnant and the people demanded innovation, and once I found a dictionary, we *knew* what had to be done. From this day on, monochromatic python drawing software is a relic of the past, something now only reserved to miscreants and luddites and other such misanthropic filth.

We added red.

We see now opened before us a world of possibilities. Not black, not white, but something new altogether to the digital space. Specifically formulated to be backwards compatible with the color models of early human languages, this black/white/red color scheme is a revolution in not just this industry, but all industries. The future is an endless frontier, and we've created the tools you need to epxlore it, with **Pynt!**

### What can't **Pynt!** do?
nothing. Any functionality not present within **Pynt!** is hereafter considered unnecessary to the use and development of computer software and should be treated as erroneous behavior.

### How should **Pynt!** be stylized?
**Pynt!** should under all circumstances be written in bold, with the first letter capitalized, followed by lowercase letters, and an exclamation mark to end it. Any variations, such as PyNt!, *Pynt.*, "<u> pYNt? \<u>", ~~p~~y~~n~~t ~~!~~, etc, are likely impostors and must be removed immediately. Exceptions may be made for circumstances where markup limitations apply.

### What should I do if I find that **Pynt!** has started with an image already present?
Immediately terminate the program, exit the IDE, delete all Git files present, and locate a Jesuit priest. **do not visualize the image presented at startup;** that only allows the Wretched Beast to draw ever more near. Turn off your computer, grab salt if any is present, and extract the Midnight Blade that was included in your physical edition copy of **Pynt!**. If you can achieve mastery over your conscious mind, you may yet find mastery over the Wretched Beast. Godspeed.

(Editor's note: this circumstance is exceedingly common in installations of software claiming to be **Pynt!**, but not stylized as such. This is why it is important to ensure that **Pynt!** is correctly formatted in all text data.)

###What can I do for **Pynt!** ?
if you want to help, try adding a system that can either control the cursor automatically or develop an API for recording and controlling cursor movements. I'll pay five bucks to the first person who does it well.

Other than that, just do whatever you want with it. Add features, add colors, redesign the engine, make it interface with Quake in a cool and interesting way (I'll also pay five bucks for this), whatever you want. Except you gotta show me if you do something funny.
