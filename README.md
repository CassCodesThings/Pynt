im good at art i promise this is just a bad example


### What is **Pynt!** ?
**Pynt!** is an extremely simple drawing program written in Pygame. Starting as a simple etch-a-sketch program I wrote after an evening at the pub, it quickly evolved into a full-fledged doodle pad, with support for multiple colors and erasing.

### How do I install **Pynt!** ?
download ``pynt v3.py`` and make sure you have the latest version of Pygame installed. If you don't, uhh, I think you can just use ``pip install pygame`` or something like that. Once that's done, open ``pynt v3.py`` in IDLE or whatever on Windows and if you're on Linux you should know what to do.

### What can **Pynt!** do?
The problems facing the internet as we understand it require the most modern and capable tools we have at our disposal. Because of this, no expense has been spared in creating this software framework. After dozens of minutes of research and development, we've perfected a patent-pending unpatentable trichromatic display technology that scoffs at the concept of a "black and white only" color scheme. The industry has become stagnant and the people demanded innovation, and once I found a dictionary, we *knew* what had to be done. From this day on, monochromatic python drawing software is a relic of the past, something now only reserved to miscreants and luddites and other such misanthropic filth.

We added red.

We saw opened before us a world of possibilities. Not black, not white, but something new altogether to the digital space. Specifically formulated to be backwards compatible with the color models of early human languages, this black/white/red color scheme was a revolution in not just this industry, but all industries. The future became an endless frontier, and with **Pynt!**, we had the tools to explore it.

Since our original groundbreaking discovery, we've continued to iterate and develop. Now, **Pynt!** has blossomed into a full-fledged piece of software, with support for mouse drawing, a visual interface, "joy" as an emotion, and the color yellow, with new features and colors being discovered nearly every day! The future is an adventure, and **Pynt!** gives us the capacity to explore it!

### What can't **Pynt!** do?
nothing. Any functionality not present within **Pynt!** is hereafter considered unnecessary to the use and development of computer software and should be treated as erroneous behavior.

### How should **Pynt!** be stylized?
**Pynt!** should under all circumstances be written in bold, with the first letter capitalized, followed by lowercase letters, and an exclamation mark to end it. Any variations, such as PyNt!, *Pynt.*, "<u> pYNt? \<u>", ~~p~~y~~n~~t ~~!~~, etc, are likely impostors and must be removed immediately. Exceptions may be made for circumstances where markup limitations apply.

### What should I do if I find that **Pynt!** has started with an image already present?
Immediately terminate the program, exit the IDE, delete all Git files present, and locate a Jesuit priest. **do not visualize the image presented at startup;** that only allows the Wretched Beast to draw ever more near. Turn off your computer, grab salt if any is present, and extract the Midnight Blade that was included in your physical edition copy of **Pynt!**. If you can achieve mastery over your conscious mind, you may yet find mastery over the Wretched Beast. Godspeed.

(Editor's note: this circumstance is exceedingly common in installations of software claiming to be **Pynt!**, but not stylized as such. This is why it is important to ensure that **Pynt!** is correctly formatted in all text data.)

### What can I do for **Pynt!** ?
Literally whatever you want. It's GPLv3 so have at it.
